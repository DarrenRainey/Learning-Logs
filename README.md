# Learning Logs
This repo is updated via a script I wrote to take my activity accross a few different platforms.

Currently: Duolingo, Lets Defend, Try Hack Me.

The script runs as a cron task on my home server and pulls down streak / course information from the public API's / leaderboards. Script maybe released at a later point / after long term testing.
