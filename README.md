# Learning Logs
This repo is updated via a script I wrote to take my activity accross a few different platforms.

Currently: Duolingo, Lets Defend, Try Hack Me.

The script runs as a cron task on my home server and pulls down streak / course information from the public API's / leaderboards. Script maybe released at a later point / after long term testing.

Note: Logger runs at 6PM each day so any tasks / streak completed after 6PM will show up in the next report (the following day).

Key events:

| Date / Time frame | Note |
| ------------------ | ---- |
| 24th-27th January 2025 | Power / internet outage due to Storm Ã‰owyn |
